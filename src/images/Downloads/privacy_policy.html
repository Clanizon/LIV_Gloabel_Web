                <ol>
                    <li>We validate the Accounts of ABITO Users by using SMS
                        verification to ensure that each account is associated with a genuine and
                        unique User. If you do not agree to validate your account, then your
                        account will remain active, and you will be able to use our Services with
                        limited functionality.</li>
                    <li>If you create several ABITO Accounts using the same mobile
                        number or email id, all such accounts will have limited functionality, and
                        you will be asked to choose one. The account you chose will return to full
                        functionality, and the rest of the accounts will remain to have limited
                        functionality or be disabled permanently.</li>
                    <li>Account validation is done once for each account until the user
                        verifies it via SMS. Once you have validated your ABITO Account, it will remain associated with the mobile number used for the SMS verification. If
                        you wish to change the mobile number associated with your ABITO
                        Account, you must contact our Customer Support team.</li>
